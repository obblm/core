Installation
==================================

Applications that use Symfony Flex
----------------------------------

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute:

```console
$ composer require obblm/core
```
Applications that don't use Symfony Flex
----------------------------------------

### Step 1: Download the Bundle

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
$ composer require obblm/core
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `config/bundles.php` file of your project:

```php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    Obblm\Core\ObblmCoreBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
### Step 3: Add the route for OBBLM in your routing

Add the bundle routes by adding it the `config/routes/obblm.yaml` file of your project:

```yaml
# config/routes/obblm.yaml

obblm:
  resource: '@ObblmCoreBundle/Resources/config/routing.yaml'
  prefix: /obblm
```
`prefix: /obblm` prefix is an exemple, you can do what you want with prefix, host and/or scheme
### Step 4: Add the configuration file for OBBLM

Add the bundle file by adding it the `config/packages` file of your project:

```yaml
# config/packages/obblm.yaml

obblm:
  email_sender:
    email: mysendermail@domain.com
    name: My Sender Name
```
